People sometimes stop and ask me, what is your secret and I just smile and walk off. Yeah it annoying and I am pretty sure they don't like it.

## Article
I have been walking for a while, since I was about 2 years old actually. Initially, not very stable but as time went by I could hold my own.

## Conclusion
Learn to walk as soon as possible, its really useful and good for the soul.
